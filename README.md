I have started reading and solving the problems in the classic CS book -- **SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**. This repository will track my progress.

Notes that I am taking down as I read this book can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/o/s!AobN8dUrobJQhqE9I-nQlutGm65KbA). I am also blogging about my experience [here](https://sicp.pratyushnalam.com).
